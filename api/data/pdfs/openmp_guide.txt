OpenMP for High Performance Computing

OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) is an API that supports multi-platform shared-memory multiprocessing programming in C, C++, and Fortran. It consists of a set of compiler directives, library routines, and environment variables that influence run-time behavior.

OpenMP Architecture:
- Based on fork-join parallelism
- Uses pragmas/directives to indicate parallel regions
- Shared-memory programming model
- Works well on multi-core processors and shared-memory multiprocessors

Key OpenMP Directives:
- #pragma omp parallel: Creates a team of threads
- #pragma omp for: Divides loop iterations among threads
- #pragma omp sections: Divides blocks of code among threads
- #pragma omp critical: Specifies a critical section
- #pragma omp atomic: Ensures atomic update of specific memory locations
- #pragma omp barrier: Synchronizes all threads in a team

Data Sharing Attributes:
- shared: Variables accessible by all threads
- private: Each thread has its own copy
- firstprivate: Private variables initialized from shared variables
- lastprivate: Shared variables updated with the value from the last iteration
- reduction: Performs a reduction operation on the specified variables

OpenMP Runtime Library Functions:
- omp_get_num_threads(): Returns the number of threads
- omp_get_thread_num(): Returns the current thread number
- omp_set_num_threads(): Sets the number of threads
- omp_get_wtime(): Returns elapsed wall clock time

OpenMP Scheduling:
- static: Loop iterations divided equally among threads (default)
- dynamic: Threads grab chunks of iterations when available
- guided: Chunk size decreases exponentially
- auto: Implementation decides the scheduling
- runtime: Determined at runtime via OMP_SCHEDULE

OpenMP is particularly effective for loop-level parallelism and is widely used in scientific computing applications. It provides a relatively simple way to parallelize existing code without major rewrites, making it popular for incrementally optimizing applications for multi-core systems.
